## Get started

To use the project clone this repo with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chingu-voyage3/grad.then.git
# or if you use SSH
git clone git@github.com:chingu-voyage3/grad.then.git
# change directory
cd grad.then
# install dependencies
npm install
# once complete run
npm run dev
# open localhost:8000
```

## Git workflow

* master: production release.
* development: Upcoming change to be merged into master.
* developer branch: Individual branches for each developer.

`development` will have PR's from developer branches merged into it, to do this:

```sh
# make your development branch
git branch dev-myUserName-issuenumber-description
# make your change and push to origin
git push --set-upstream origin dev-myUserName-issuenumber-description
```

Complete your PR through the GitHub UI

As a good working practice request that another team member review and merge
your PR for a sanity check

The `master` and `development` branches are protected so that the person
submitting the PR can not merge it.

this will ensure at least one other team mate has seen the code before merging
with either `master` or `development` branches.
